## [LAUNCH] HOW TO USE

### View Text Files
```powershell
# Open txt folder
explorer txt\

# View specific file
notepad txt\VISUAL_START_GUIDE.txt

# View documentation reference
notepad txt\DOCUMENTATION.txt
```

### Create New Text Files
**ALWAYS save new .txt files to `txt\` directory:**
```powershell
# CORRECT
notepad txt\NEW_GUIDE.txt

# WRONG - DO NOT DO THIS
notepad NEW_GUIDE.txt
```

### Access from Scripts
When referencing text files in scripts:
```powershell
# Use relative path from root
$guide = Get-Content "txt\VISUAL_START_GUIDE.txt"

# Or absolute path
$guide = Get-Content "C:\Users\johng\Documents\Erevus\orfeas\txt\VISUAL_START_GUIDE.txt"
```
