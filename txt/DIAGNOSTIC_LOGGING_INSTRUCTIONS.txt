â•' Diagnostic logging has been added to backend/main.py â•'
â•' This will show exactly which processor is being used and why. â•'
â•' â•'


##  CHANGES MADE

### 1. Diagnostic Logging Added to main.py

**Location: Line ~2437 (standard_3d_generation function)**

Added comprehensive logging that will show:
-  Processor status (exists, type, ready state)
-  Testing mode status
-  Quality validator status
-  Which code path is taken (placeholder vs Full AI)
-  Quality validation parameters
-  Result type and quality metrics presence

**Location: Line ~707 (load_models_background function)**

Added logging to confirm:
-  When Full AI processor loading starts
-  Processor type after loading
-  When processor is ready for requests

### 2. Automated Test Script Created

**File: RUN_DIAGNOSTIC_TEST.ps1**

This script will:
1. Stop any existing backend
2. Clear output cache
3. Create unique test image
4. Start backend in new window with diagnostic logging
5. Wait for models to load (45 seconds)
6. Run quality integration test
7. Show results

##  HOW TO RUN THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST

### OPTION A: Automated (Recommended)

```powershell
.\RUN_DIAGNOSTIC_TEST.ps1
```

This will:
- Start backend in separate window
- Wait for initialization
- Run test automatically
- Show results

**Watch both windows:**
- Current window: Test progress and results
- New window: Backend logs with [DIAGNOSTIC] entries

### OPTION B: Manual (More Control)

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```powershell
cd backend
$env:FLASK_ENV='production'
$env:TESTING='0'
$env:GPU_MEMORY_LIMIT='0.8'
$env:DISABLE_RESULT_CACHE='1'
python main.py
```

**Wait for these log entries:**
```
[DIAGNOSTIC] About to call get_3d_processor()...
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Processor loaded: <TypeName>
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Full AI processor ready for requests!
```

**Terminal 2 (Test - after ~45 seconds):**
```powershell
# Create unique test image
python create_test_image.py temp/test_images/diagnostic_test.png

# Run test
python test_quality_quick.py
```

##  WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### In Backend Terminal:

**During Startup:**
```
[DIAGNOSTIC] About to call get_3d_processor()...
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Processor loaded: Hunyuan3DProcessor  ← Should be Hunyuan3DProcessor
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Full AI processor ready for requests!
```

**During Generation Request:**
```
[DIAGNOSTIC] Processor Status Check:
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - is_testing: False              ← Should be False
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - processor_3d exists: True      ← Should be True
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - processor_type: Hunyuan3DProcessor  ← Should be Hunyuan3DProcessor
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - models_ready: True             ← Should be True
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - quality_validator exists: True ← Should be True
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Using processor: Hunyuan3DProcessor
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Processor has image_to_3d_generation method
[DIAGNOSTIC] Quality Validation Parameters:
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - quality_validator: <object>
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - track_quality: True            ← Should be True
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - is_testing: False
[DIAGNOSTIC] Generation completed, result type: <class 'tuple'>
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Result is tuple: success=True, has_metrics=True
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Quality metrics present: ['bg_removal', 'shape', 'texture', 'final', 'overall_score', ...]
```

**BAD Signs (indicate problem):**
```
[DIAGNOSTIC]  Using placeholder generation           ← Should NOT see this
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - processor_type: FallbackProcessor    ← Should be Hunyuan3DProcessor
[DIAGNOSTIC]   - processor_3d exists: False           ← Should be True
[DIAGNOSTIC]  No quality metrics in successful result
```

### In Test Output:

**SUCCESS:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "progress": 100,
  "quality_metrics": {                    ← This should be present!
    "overall_score": 0.85,
    "quality_grade": "B",
    "printable": true
  }
}
```

**FAILURE:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "progress": 100
  // No quality_metrics field  ← This is what we're trying to fix
}
```

##  EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Scenario 1: Full AI Processor Working 

**Backend logs show:**
- Processor type: Hunyuan3DProcessor
- Quality metrics present
- No errors

**Test output shows:**
- quality_metrics in response
- Overall score, grade, printable flag

**Conclusion:** Quality integration is working! Just needed to wait for models.

### Scenario 2: Processor is None 

**Backend logs show:**
- processor_3d exists: False
- Using placeholder generation

**Cause:** Background loading failed or hasn't completed
**Fix:** Check for exceptions in model loading, extend wait time

### Scenario 3: Processor is Fallback 

**Backend logs show:**
- processor_type: FallbackProcessor
- Using processor but no quality metrics

**Cause:** Full AI loading failed, fell back to Fallback
**Fix:** Check earlier logs for loading exceptions

### Scenario 4: No Quality Metrics Despite Full AI 

**Backend logs show:**
- processor_type: Hunyuan3DProcessor
- track_quality: False OR
- quality_validator exists: False

**Cause:** Quality validator not initialized or not passed
**Fix:** Check quality_validator initialization in main.py

### Scenario 5: Exception During Generation 

**Backend logs show:**
- Processor type: Hunyuan3DProcessor
- Traceback or error during generation

**Cause:** CUDA error, model inference failure
**Fix:** Check GPU memory, CUDA compatibility

##  TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Backend Won't Start
- Check port 5000 is available: `netstat -an | findstr :5000`
- Check for Python errors in terminal
- Verify CUDA/PyTorch installation

### If Models Won't Load
- Check GPU memory: Should show ~5GB allocated
- Check HuggingFace cache: `~/.cache/huggingface/`
- Verify internet connection (first download)

### If Test Fails to Connect
- Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure no other service on port 5000

##  NEXT STEPS AFTER DIAGNOSTIC

Once you run the diagnostic test, we'll know EXACTLY:

1. **Which processor is being used** (Full AI vs Fallback vs None)
2. **Why that processor was chosen** (testing mode, missing, failed load)
3. **If quality validation is being called** (track_quality parameter)
4. **If quality metrics are being generated** (result analysis)
5. **Where the failure occurs** (loading, routing, generation, return)

Then we can apply the **specific fix** for the identified issue.
