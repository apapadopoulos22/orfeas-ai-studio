## [TARGET] WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW

When you open `orfeas-studio.html` in your browser, you'll see one of these:


### Scenario 1: Backend Already Running [OK]
```

                                                            
  [OK] Backend Connected!                                     
  ORFEAS backend is running and ready.                     
                                                            


(Green banner at top of page, disappears after 3 seconds)
```


### Scenario 2: Backend Offline (AUTO-START TRIGGERS!)
```
Step 1 (Appears immediately):

                                                            
  [WARN] Backend Server Required                                
  ORFEAS backend is not running. Click below to start.     
                                                            
  [[LAUNCH] Start Backend Server]                                 
                                                            


(Red banner at top of page)


Step 2 (After 2 seconds - AUTOMATIC!):

                                                            
  [WAIT] Starting Backend Server...                             
  Opening project folder. Double-click                      
  "[LAUNCH] START ORFEAS.bat" to start backend.                   
                                                            


(Yellow banner, File Explorer may open to project folder)


Step 3 (You double-click [LAUNCH] START ORFEAS.bat):

                                                            
  [WAIT] Waiting for Backend...                                 
  Checking connection... (5/30 seconds)                     
                                                            


(Yellow banner, monitoring connection every second)


Step 4 (After ~15 seconds):

                                                            
  [OK] Backend Connected!                                     
  ORFEAS backend is running and ready.                     
                                                            


(Green banner, disappears after 3 seconds)
```
