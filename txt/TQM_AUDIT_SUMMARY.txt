 RECOMMENDATIONS


 HIGH PRIORITY
   Dimension: Code Quality (73.4%)
   Issue: Below 80% quality threshold

   Specific Improvements Needed:

   1. Type Hint Coverage (47.7% → 80%+)
      • Add type hints to 41+ additional files
      • Focus on function signatures and return types
      • Use typing module for complex types

   2. Error Handling Coverage (74.2% → 80%+)
      • Add try-except blocks to 7+ additional files
      • Implement contextual error handling
      • Add proper logging for exceptions

   Action Items:
    Run: python -m mypy backend/ --install-types
    Add type hints to high-traffic modules first
    Implement comprehensive error handling patterns
    Review and enhance exception handling in critical paths

 MEDIUM PRIORITY
   Missing Files:
   • Create README.md in project root
   • Add .gitignore for version control
