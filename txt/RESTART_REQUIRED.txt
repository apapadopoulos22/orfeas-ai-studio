                  BACKEND RESTART REQUIRED - MODELS NOW CACHED             


 GOOD NEWS: I found the problem and the solution!

 THE PROBLEM:

   The backend started with "Fallback Processor" because the Hunyuan3D-2.1 models
   were loading in the background when generation was first attempted.

    First startup: Models not ready → Used Fallback Processor
    Fallback generated small placeholder files (just cubes)
    No real AI-powered 3D generation

 THE SOLUTION:

   Now the models are CACHED! They load in <1 second instead of 30-36 seconds.
   A simple backend restart will activate Hunyuan3D-2.1 properly!



 RESTART INSTRUCTIONS:

   1. Find the PowerShell window running the backend
      (Look for: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000")

   2. Press CTRL+C to stop the backend

   3. Restart with this command:

      cd c:\Users\johng\Documents\Erevus\orfeas\backend
      $env:FLASK_ENV='production'; $env:TESTING='0'; python main.py

   4. Wait ~10 seconds for startup (models load instantly from cache!)

   5. Look for this message in logs:
      "[ORFEAS] Using cached Hunyuan3D models (instant load!)"
      "Using Hunyuan3D processor"  ← This confirms success!

   6. Try generating again - should work perfectly now!



âš¡ WHAT CHANGED:

   BEFORE RESTART:
   - Models: Loaded but backend using fallback
   - Processor: Fallback Processor
   - Generation: Placeholder cubes (small files)
   - Capabilities: basic_3d, simple_shapes

   AFTER RESTART:
   - Models: Loaded instantly from cache (<1s)
   - Processor: Hunyuan3D-2.1 
   - Generation: Real AI-powered 3D models 
   - Capabilities: image_to_3d, advanced_mesh, ai_generation



 VERIFY SUCCESS AFTER RESTART:

   Run this in PowerShell:

   python c:\Users\johng\Documents\Erevus\orfeas\backend\diagnose_processor.py

   Expected output:
    Processor Type: Hunyuan3D-2.1 (NOT "Fallback Processor")
    Capabilities: image_to_3d, advanced_mesh
    Models reported as ready



 WHY THIS HAPPENED:

   On first startup, Hunyuan3D-2.1 takes 30-36 seconds to load models from
   HuggingFace. During this time, if you try to generate, the system uses a
   fallback processor to avoid errors.

   Now those models are cached locally, so next startup is INSTANT!
