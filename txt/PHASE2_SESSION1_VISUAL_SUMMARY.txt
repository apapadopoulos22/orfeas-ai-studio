 LESSONS LEARNED


1. Dynamic Batch Sizing
   • VRAM estimation formula: 2GB × size_factor × step_factor
   • Safety margin critical: 1GB minimum
   • Queue size integration prevents over-batching

2. Performance Profiling
   • Context managers ideal for stage profiling
   • 20% threshold good for bottleneck detection
   • Stage-specific recommendations increase actionability

3. Singleton Pattern
   • Essential for maintaining profiling state
   • Prevents duplicate GPU manager instances
   • Simplifies integration across modules
