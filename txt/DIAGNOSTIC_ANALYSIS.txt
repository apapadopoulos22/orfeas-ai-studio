 CRITICAL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION NEEDED FROM BACKEND TERMINAL


PLEASE CHECK THE BACKEND TERMINAL WINDOW FOR THESE LOG ENTRIES:

1. **MODEL LOADING CONFIRMATION:**
   Look for:
   ```
   [DIAGNOSTIC] About to call get_3d_processor()...
   [DIAGNOSTIC]  Processor loaded: <TypeName>
   [DIAGNOSTIC]  Full AI processor ready for requests!
   ```

   → TypeName should be "Hunyuan3DProcessor"
   → If "FallbackProcessor", models failed to load
   → If this log is MISSING, get_3d_processor() was never called

2. **PROCESSOR STATUS CHECK (During Request):**
   Look for:
   ```
   [DIAGNOSTIC] Processor Status Check:
   [DIAGNOSTIC]   - is_testing: False
   [DIAGNOSTIC]   - processor_3d exists: True
   [DIAGNOSTIC]   - processor_type: Hunyuan3DProcessor
   [DIAGNOSTIC]   - models_ready: True
   [DIAGNOSTIC]   - quality_validator exists: True
   ```

   → processor_3d exists should be True
   → processor_type should be "Hunyuan3DProcessor"
   → quality_validator exists should be True

3. **ROUTING DECISION:**
   Look for:
   ```
   [DIAGNOSTIC]  Routing decision: Using Full AI Processor
   ```
   OR
   ```
   [DIAGNOSTIC]  Routing decision: Using FallbackProcessor (placeholder)
   ```

   → Should say "Using Full AI Processor"
   → If "FallbackProcessor", that's the problem!

4. **QUALITY VALIDATION EXECUTION:**
   Look for:
   ```
   [DIAGNOSTIC] Quality validation parameters:
   [DIAGNOSTIC]   - quality_validator: <GenerationQualityValidator object>
   [DIAGNOSTIC]   - track_quality: True
   [DIAGNOSTIC] Result type: <class 'tuple'>
   [DIAGNOSTIC] Quality metrics present: [...]
   ```

   → track_quality should be True
   → Result type should be 'tuple'
   → Quality metrics should be a dict

5. **QUALITY STAGE LOGS:**
   Look for:
   ```
   [QUALITY] Stage: bg_removal | Score: 0.XX | Status: pass/fail
   [QUALITY] Stage: shape | Score: 0.XX | Status: pass/fail
   [QUALITY] Stage: texture | Score: 0.XX | Status: pass/fail
   [QUALITY] Stage: final | Score: 0.XX | Status: pass/fail
   ```

   → Should appear for each stage
   → If MISSING, quality validation was never called


 DIAGNOSTIC SCENARIOS & SOLUTIONS


SCENARIO 1: processor_type = "FallbackProcessor"
  CAUSE: Full AI models failed to load or get_3d_processor() returned fallback
  FIX: Check model loading logs for exceptions, verify HUNYUAN3D_PATH
  LOCATION: backend/main.py line ~707, backend/gpu_init.py

SCENARIO 2: processor_3d exists = False
  CAUSE: Background model loading not complete or failed silently
  FIX: Increase model loading wait time or make loading synchronous
  LOCATION: backend/main.py line ~703-715

SCENARIO 3: quality_validator exists = False
  CAUSE: Quality validator initialization failed
  FIX: Check __init__ in main.py, verify quality_validator.py import
  LOCATION: backend/main.py line ~530-540

SCENARIO 4: is_testing = True
  CAUSE: TESTING environment variable is set to '1'
  FIX: Set TESTING=0 or remove environment variable
  LOCATION: backend/.env or system environment

SCENARIO 5: No [DIAGNOSTIC] logs at all
  CAUSE: Request went to different code path (cached, error, etc.)
  FIX: Check for error logs, verify DISABLE_RESULT_CACHE=1
  LOCATION: Check full backend log output


 NEXT STEPS


STEP 1: Review Backend Terminal
  → Find the backend terminal window that was started by the diagnostic script
  → Scroll to find [DIAGNOSTIC] log entries
  → Copy relevant sections (especially items 1-4 above)

STEP 2: Identify Root Cause
  → Match backend logs to one of the 5 scenarios above
  → Determine exact reason quality metrics are missing

STEP 3: Apply Targeted Fix
  → Make specific code change based on diagnostic findings
  → Restart backend with fix applied

STEP 4: Re-validate
  → Run test_diagnostic_quick.py again
  → Verify quality_metrics appear in response
  → Verify [QUALITY] logs appear in backend terminal



CURRENT STATUS:  AWAITING BACKEND LOG REVIEW

The test has been executed. Quality metrics are confirmed MISSING.
The diagnostic logs in the backend terminal will reveal exactly why.

Please review the backend terminal and share the [DIAGNOSTIC] log entries.
