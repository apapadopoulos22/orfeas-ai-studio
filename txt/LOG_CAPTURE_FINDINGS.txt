**THE PROBLEM:**

The Tee-Object command in RESTART_WITH_DIAGNOSTIC_LOGS.ps1 is NOT capturing
logs from Flask request handlers during actual HTTP requests.

**WHY THIS HAPPENS:**

1. **Python Logging Buffering:**
   - Flask request handlers run in separate threads
   - Python's logging module buffers output
   - Tee-Object only sees flushed output
   - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 helps but doesn't fully solve threading issues

2. **Werkzeug (Flask Dev Server) Behavior:**
   - Request logs go through werkzeug logger
   - May use different output streams
   - Threading can cause logs to be delayed or not flushed

3. **Windows PowerShell Tee-Object Limitations:**
   - Tee-Object buffers input before writing
   - Doesn't capture stderr properly in some cases
   - May lose logs from background threads

**OPTION 1: Check Backend Terminal Window** Ã¢Â­ï¿½ IMMEDIATE
The logs ARE being generated - they're just not in the file!

ACTION: Look at the actual PowerShell window running the backend
EXPECTED: You'll see all the [DIAGNOSTIC] and [QUALITY] logs there

**OPTION 2: Add Explicit Log Flushing**
Modify main.py to force flush logs after each write:

```python
import sys
import logging

# Configure logging with immediate flushing
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s | %(levelname)-8s | %(name)-15s | %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    ]
)

# After each log:
logger.info("[DIAGNOSTIC] Something")
sys.stdout.flush()  # Force immediate output
```

**OPTION 3: Use Python's Logging to File**
Instead of Tee-Object, log directly to file in Python:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s | %(levelname)-8s | %(name)-15s | %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout),  # Console
        logging.FileHandler('logs/backend.log', mode='a')  # File
    ]
)
```

**OPTION 4: Use Process Monitor Tool**
Run a Windows Process Monitor to capture all output:
- DebugView
- Process Explorer
- Custom log capture script

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

1. Run the new utility script:
   ```powershell
   .\CAPTURE_BACKEND_LOGS.ps1
   ```

   This will:
   - Check if backend is running
   - Offer to run a test with live log monitoring
   - Help determine if logs are being generated at all

2. OR manually check the backend terminal:
   - Find PowerShell window with "python main.py"
   - Look for logs from 22:42:21 timestamp
   - Copy any [DIAGNOSTIC] or [QUALITY] logs
   - Save to: txt\BACKEND_TERMINAL_LOGS.txt

**AFTER CAPTURING LOGS:**

If logs ARE in terminal but NOT in file:
  â†’ Implement OPTION 3 (Python file logging)

If logs are NOT in terminal either:
  â†’ The diagnostic code isn't running
  â†’ Check execution path (Todo #2)
  â†’ Check if standard_3d_generation is called (Todo #5)

ï¿½ HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

**THEORY 1: Logs exist in terminal** (MOST LIKELY)
- Tee-Object simply isn't capturing request logs
- All diagnostic code is working
- Just need better log capture

**THEORY 2: Logs don't exist anywhere** (LESS LIKELY)
- standard_3d_generation() not being called
- Different code path is executing
- Diagnostic logging code has issues

**HOW TO VALIDATE:**

Run: .\CAPTURE_BACKEND_LOGS.ps1

If it offers to run a test and shows "No new logs captured":
  â†’ THEORY 2 is correct (code path issue)

If manual terminal check shows logs:
  â†’ THEORY 1 is correct (Tee-Object issue)
