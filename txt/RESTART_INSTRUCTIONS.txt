â•'              Activate New Python File Logging System                         â•'


 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:


STEP 1: STOP CURRENT BACKEND


1. Find the PowerShell window that's running the backend
   (Look for window with "python main.py" or Flask server output)

2. Press Ctrl+C in that window to stop the backend

3. Wait for the process to fully terminate (you'll see the command prompt return)


STEP 2: RESTART BACKEND WITH NEW LOGGING


In the SAME PowerShell window, run these commands:

cd c:\Users\johng\Documents\Erevus\orfeas\backend
$env:FLASK_ENV='production'
$env:TESTING='0'
python main.py


STEP 3: VERIFY NEW LOGGING IS ACTIVE


Watch the startup output. You MUST see these new lines:

 LOOK FOR THESE:
[ORFEAS] Dual logging initialized: console + logs/backend_requests.log
[ORFEAS] File rotation: 10MB per file, 5 backups (50MB total)

If you see those lines, the new logging is ACTIVE! 

If you DON'T see those lines, something went wrong. 


STEP 4: RETURN HERE AND RUN TEST


Once the backend is restarted and you see the new logging messages:

1. Return to THIS terminal window
2. Run: .\TEST_FILE_LOGGING.ps1
3. The test will automatically verify the logging is working


ALTERNATIVE: AUTOMATED RESTART (if you prefer)


If you want guided assistance:

Run: .\RESTART_AND_TEST.ps1

This will:
- Give you step-by-step instructions
- Wait for you to restart the backend manually
- Verify the backend is running
- Automatically run the logging test


TROUBLESHOOTING


 If backend won't start:
   - Check for Python errors in the output
   - Verify you're in the backend directory
   - Check if port 5000 is already in use

 If you don't see the new logging messages:
   - Make sure you restarted the backend (not just refreshed)
   - Check that main.py has the new code (should have log_with_flush)
   - Try: Get-Content backend\main.py | Select-String "Dual logging"

 If backend seems to hang:
   - Wait 30-40 seconds for models to load
   - You should see "Processor loaded: Hunyuan3DProcessor"
   - Then "Full AI processor ready for requests!"



 READY TO PROCEED?

Once you've restarted the backend and see the new logging messages,
come back to this terminal and run:

.\TEST_FILE_LOGGING.ps1
