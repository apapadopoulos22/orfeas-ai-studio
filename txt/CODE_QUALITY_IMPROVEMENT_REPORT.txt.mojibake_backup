Week 1:
  Day 1: Install mypy and configure type checking
         Command: pip install mypy
         Command: python -m mypy backend/ --install-types

  Day 2-3: Add type hints to high-priority files (main.py, hunyuan_integration.py, etc.)
           Focus on function signatures: def func(param: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:

  Day 4-5: Add type hints to remaining files
           Use typing module: from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any

Week 2:
  Day 1-2: Add error handling to files without try-except blocks
           Template:
           try:
               result = operation()
           except SpecificException as e:
               logger.error(f"[ORFEAS] Operation failed: {e}")
               handle_error(e)

  Day 3: Run validation checks
         Command: python -m mypy backend/
         Command: pytest backend/tests/ -v

  Day 4: Re-run TQM audit
         Command: python run_tqm_audit.py
         Target: 80%+ code quality score

  Day 5: Final validation and documentation update
