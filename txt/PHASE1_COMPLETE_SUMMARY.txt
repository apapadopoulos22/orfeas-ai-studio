   Production Excellence Certification


 TECHNICAL APPROACH


Type Hints Strategy:
  1. Add "from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any" to files
  2. Add return type hints: def func() -> ReturnType:
  3. Add parameter type hints: def func(param: Type) -> ReturnType:
  4. Use mypy to identify and fix type errors iteratively

Error Handling Strategy:
  1. Wrap risky operations in try-except blocks
  2. Use specific exception types (not bare except)
  3. Add logging: logger.error(f"[ORFEAS] Operation failed: {e}")
  4. Implement graceful degradation and fallbacks

Quality Validation:
  1. Run mypy after each batch of changes
  2. Run pytest to ensure no functional breakage
  3. Re-run TQM audit daily to track progress
  4. Review generated .bak files before committing
