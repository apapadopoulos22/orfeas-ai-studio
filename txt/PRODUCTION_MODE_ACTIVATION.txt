 NEXT STEPS: TEST QUALITY INTEGRATION


STEP 1: WAIT FOR MODEL LOADING (in progress)

  Current: Hunyuan3D models downloading/loading
  Watch for: [ORFEAS] Using cached Hunyuan3D models
  Time remaining: ~20-30 seconds

STEP 2: RUN QUALITY TEST

  Command:
    cd c:\Users\johng\Documents\Erevus\orfeas
    python test_quality_proper.py

  Expected Output:
    [STEP 1] Uploading test image...
    [SUCCESS] Image uploaded!

    [STEP 2] Starting 3D generation with quality validation...
    [SUCCESS] 3D generation started!

    [STEP 3] Monitoring job status (checking for quality metrics)...
    [STATUS] generating_3d - Progress: 0%
    [STATUS] generating_3d - Progress: 20%
    [STATUS] generating_3d - Progress: 50%
    [SUCCESS] Quality metrics found in response!
    {
      "overall_score": 0.89,
      "quality_grade": "A-",
      "printable": true,
      "bg_removal": {"score": 0.85, ...},
      "shape": {"score": 0.92, ...},
      "texture": {"score": 0.88, ...},
      "final": {"score": 0.91, ...}
    }

    [STEP 4] Checking Prometheus metrics...
    [SUCCESS] Found 7/7 quality metrics

STEP 3: VERIFY BACKEND LOGS

  Watch backend terminal for [QUALITY] entries:

    [QUALITY] Validating background removal...
    [QUALITY] Background removal score: 0.850
    [QUALITY] Validating shape generation...
    [QUALITY] Shape generation score: 0.920, manifold: True
    [QUALITY] Auto-repair applied: fill_holes, fix_normals
    [QUALITY] Overall quality: 0.890 (Grade: A-)

STEP 4: CHECK PROMETHEUS METRICS

  Open: http://localhost:5000/metrics

  Look for:
    quality_overall_score 0.89
    quality_bg_removal_score 0.85
    quality_shape_score 0.92
    quality_texture_score 0.88
    quality_final_score 0.91
    quality_grade_total{grade="A-"} 1
    quality_manifold_rate 1.0
    quality_printable_rate 1.0

STEP 5: VIEW GRAFANA DASHBOARD (Optional)

  If Grafana running, access:
    URL: http://localhost:3000
    Username: admin
    Password: orfeas_admin_2025

  Quality Panels (15-24):
    - Panel 15: Overall Quality Gauge (89%)
    - Panel 16: Stage Scores (BG/Shape/Texture/Final)
    - Panel 17: Auto-Repairs Counter
    - Panel 19: Quality Trend Graph
    - Panel 23: Validation Failures (should be zero)

 QUALITY METRICS INTEGRATION - COMPLETE OVERVIEW


STAGE 1: Background Removal Validation

  Metrics:
    - Coverage: % of background successfully removed
    - Sharpness: Edge quality after removal
    - Preservation: Subject detail retention
  Weight: coverage*0.4 + sharpness*0.3 + preservation*0.3

STAGE 2: Shape Generation Validation

  Metrics:
    - Manifold: Is mesh watertight? (critical)
    - Triangle count: Within optimal range?
    - Topology: Proper edge/face ratios
  Weight: manifold*0.4 + triangles*0.2 + topology*0.2 + ...

STAGE 3: Texture Coherence Validation

  Metrics:
    - Resolution: Texture quality
    - Diversity: Color variation
    - Contrast: Visual clarity
    - Detail: Fine features present
  Weight: resolution*0.3 + diversity*0.25 + contrast*0.25 + detail*0.2

  Metrics:
    - Watertight: 100% sealed?
    - Normal consistency: Proper face orientation
    - No intersections: Self-intersection check
