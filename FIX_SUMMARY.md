# ORFEAS Windows Server - Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** AttributeError when loading model background

- Error: `'Hunyuan3DProcessor' object has no attribute 'texgen_pipeline'`
- Location: `hunyuan_integration.py`, line 239 in `load_model_background_safe()`
- Impact: Server crashed on startup after model loading completed

## Root Cause

In the `__init__` method of `Hunyuan3DProcessor` class, only `self.shapegen_pipeline` was initialized, but `load_model_background_safe()` method tried to access:

- `self.texgen_pipeline`
- `self.rembg`
- `self.text2image_pipeline`

These attributes were referenced but never initialized, causing AttributeError.

## Solution Applied

Added proper initialization of all required attributes in `__init__`:

```python
def __init__(self, device: Union[str, None] = None) -> None:
    self.device = device or ("cuda" if TORCH_AVAILABLE and getattr(torch, "cuda", None) and torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    self.model_loaded = False
    self.has_text2image = False
    self.shapegen_pipeline = None
    self.texgen_pipeline = None          # ← ADDED
    self.rembg = None                     # ← ADDED
    self.text2image_pipeline = None       # ← ADDED

    # ... rest of init code
```

## Changes Made

**File:** `c:\Users\johng\Documents\oscar\backend\hunyuan_integration.py`

**Lines:** 63-77 (added 3 attribute initializations)

**What Changed:**

- Added `self.texgen_pipeline = None`
- Added `self.rembg = None`
- Added `self.text2image_pipeline = None`

These ensure all attributes referenced in `load_model_background_safe()` are available.

## Verification ✅

Server now starts successfully:

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
* Running on http://192.168.1.57:5000
```

No AttributeError on model loading in background thread.

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Server is now running and ready for 3D generation

## Next Steps

1. Test 3D generation with sample image
2. Verify mesh output (.stl format)
3. Monitor GPU memory usage
4. Deploy to production
