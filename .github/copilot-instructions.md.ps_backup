## [2] CORE ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### [2.1] HUNYUAN3D-2.1 INTEGRATION

**CRITICAL MODEL LOADING:**

- First initialization: 30-36 seconds (loads 8GB+ models to GPU)
- Singleton caching: Subsequent loads <1s (94% faster via `_model_cache`)
- XFORMERS DISABLED: `os.environ["XFORMERS_DISABLED"] = "1"` prevents DLL crashes (0xc0000139)
- Models: `shapegen_pipeline`, `texgen_pipeline`, `rembg`, `text2image_pipeline`

**CORRECT INITIALIZATION PATTERN:**

```python
# backend/hunyuan_integration.py
class Hunyuan3DProcessor:
    _model_cache = {'shapegen_pipeline': None, 'texgen_pipeline': None, 'initialized': False}
    _cache_lock = threading.Lock()

    def __init__(self, device=None):
        with Hunyuan3DProcessor._cache_lock:
            if Hunyuan3DProcessor._model_cache['initialized']:
                # 🔥 INSTANT: Use cached models (~1s)
                self.shapegen_pipeline = Hunyuan3DProcessor._model_cache['shapegen_pipeline']
                return
        # First time: Load models from Hunyuan3D-2.1 directory (30-36s)
        self.initialize_model()
```

**GENERATION WORKFLOW:**

```python
# 1. Background removal (rembg)
processed_image = processor.rembg.remove_background(image)

# 2. Shape generation (Hunyuan3D-DiT-v2-1)
mesh = processor.shapegen_pipeline(image=processed_image, num_inference_steps=50)

# 3. Texture synthesis (Hunyuan3D-Paint-v2-1)
textured_mesh = processor.texgen_pipeline(mesh=mesh, image=processed_image)

# 4. Export to STL/OBJ/GLB
mesh.export('output.stl')
```

### [2.1.1] AI VIDEO COMPOSITION (SORA-INSPIRED)

**CINEMATIC VIDEO GENERATION:**

The ORFEAS platform includes advanced AI video composition capabilities inspired by OpenAI's Sora, enabling the creation of cinematic video content from text prompts, images, or 3D models.

**VIDEO PROCESSING PIPELINE:**

```python
# backend/sora_video_integration.py
class SoraVideoProcessor:
    """
    Sora-inspired video composition engine for cinematic content generation
    """

    def __init__(self, device=None):
        self.device = device or "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
        self.video_models = {
            'text_to_video': None,
            'image_to_video': None,
            '3d_to_video': None,
            'style_transfer': None
        }
        self.motion_models = {
            'camera_motion': None,
            'object_motion': None,
            'lighting_dynamics': None
        }

    def generate_cinematic_video(self, input_data: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Generate cinematic video from various inputs"""

        # 1. Analyze input content
        content_analysis = self.analyze_content(input_data)

        # 2. Generate motion sequences
        motion_sequence = self.generate_motion_sequence(content_analysis)

        # 3. Apply cinematic techniques
        cinematic_frames = self.apply_cinematic_techniques(motion_sequence)

        # 4. Render final video
        video_output = self.render_video(cinematic_frames)

        return video_output
```

**VIDEO GENERATION WORKFLOWS:**

```python
# 1. Text-to-Video Generation
video = processor.text_to_video(
    prompt="A futuristic city with flying cars at sunset",
    duration=10,  # seconds
    fps=24,
    resolution=(1920, 1080),
    style="cinematic"
)

# 2. 3D Model to Video Animation
video = processor.model_to_video(
    model_path="generated_model.stl",
    animation_type="turntable",
    lighting="studio",
    background="gradient"
)

# 3. Image to Video Expansion
video = processor.image_to_video(
    image="input.jpg",
    motion_type="camera_zoom",
    depth_estimation=True,
    parallax_effect=True
)
```

**CINEMATIC FEATURES:**

- **Camera Movements:** Dolly, pan, tilt, zoom, orbit, tracking shots

### [2.1.2] AI CODE DEVELOPMENT & DEBUGGING

**INTELLIGENT CODE GENERATION:**

The ORFEAS platform includes advanced AI-powered code development capabilities for intelligent code writing, automated debugging, and code quality optimization.

**CODE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE:**

```python
# backend/code_writer.py
class IntelligentCodeWriter:
    """
    AI-powered code generation and development assistant
    """

    def __init__(self, model="github-copilot"):
        self.model = model
        self.code_models = {
            'github-copilot': None,
            'codeT5': None,
            'starcoder': None,
            'deepseek-coder': None
        }
        self.quality_analyzer = CodeQualityAnalyzer()

    def generate_code(self, prompt: str, language: str, context: Dict = None) -> Dict:
        """Generate code from natural language description"""

        # 1. Analyze requirements
        requirements = self.analyze_requirements(prompt, context)

        # 2. Generate code structure
        code_structure = self.generate_code_structure(requirements, language)

        # 3. Generate implementation
        code_implementation = self.generate_implementation(code_structure, requirements)

        # 4. Apply code optimization
        optimized_code = self.optimize_code(code_implementation, language)

        return {
            'code': optimized_code,
            'quality_score': self.quality_analyzer.analyze(optimized_code),
            'documentation': self.generate_documentation(optimized_code),
            'tests': self.generate_tests(optimized_code) if context.get('generate_tests') else None
        }
```

**CODE DEBUGGING WORKFLOW:**

```python
# backend/code_debugger.py
class AutomatedCodeDebugger:
    """
    AI-powered code debugging and error resolution
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.error_patterns = self.load_error_patterns()
        self.fix_strategies = self.load_fix_strategies()

    def debug_code(self, code: str, error_trace: str, language: str) -> Dict:
        """Automatically debug and fix code issues"""

        # 1. Analyze error
        error_analysis = self.analyze_error(error_trace, code)

        # 2. Identify root cause
        root_cause = self.identify_root_cause(error_analysis, code)

        # 3. Generate fix
        fix_suggestion = self.generate_fix(root_cause, code, language)

        # 4. Validate fix
        validated_fix = self.validate_fix(fix_suggestion, code)

        return {
            'error_type': error_analysis['type'],
            'root_cause': root_cause,
            'fix_suggestion': validated_fix,
            'confidence': error_analysis['confidence'],
            'explanation': self.generate_explanation(root_cause, validated_fix)
        }
```

**CODE DEVELOPMENT FEATURES:**

- **Natural Language to Code:** Generate code from plain English descriptions
- **Code Completion:** Intelligent autocomplete and suggestion system
- **Bug Detection:** Automated identification of potential issues
- **Code Optimization:** Performance and quality improvements
- **Test Generation:** Automatic unit test creation
- **Documentation:** Auto-generated code documentation
- **Code Review:** AI-powered code review and suggestions
- **Refactoring:** Intelligent code restructuring and improvement

### [2.2] GPU MEMORY MANAGEMENT

**RTX 3090 OPTIMIZATION (24GB VRAM):**

- Model cache: ~8GB (persistent)
- Active generation: ~6-10GB
- Safety margin: 80% limit via `GPU_MEMORY_LIMIT=0.8`
- Auto-cleanup: torch.cuda.empty_cache() after each generation

**CORRECT GPU MANAGER USAGE:**

```python
# backend/gpu_manager.py
gpu_mgr = get_gpu_manager()

if gpu_mgr.can_process_job(estimated_vram=6000):  # 6GB estimate
    with gpu_mgr.allocate_job(job_id):
        result = generate_3d_model(image)
        gpu_mgr.cleanup_after_job()  # Force CUDA cache clear
else:
    # Queue job for later or reject
    raise ResourceError("GPU memory insufficient")
```

**NEVER:**

- Load models without checking available VRAM
- Skip `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` between generations
- Process concurrent jobs without queue management

### [2.3] FLASK API ARCHITECTURE

**ENDPOINT PATTERN:**

```python
@app.route('/api/generate-3d', methods=['POST'])
@track_request_metrics('generate_3d')  # Prometheus tracking
@security_headers  # CORS and security headers
def generate_3d():
    """
    Text/Image → 3D STL generation

    Request: multipart/form-data with 'image' file or 'prompt' text
    Response: Binary STL file or JSON with job_id for async processing
    Metrics: Tracked via prometheus_metrics.py
    """
    # 1. Validate input (validation.py)
    validator = FileUploadValidator()
    image = validator.validate_image(request.files.get('image'))

    # 2. Check rate limits
    if not get_rate_limiter().check_limit(request.remote_addr):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Rate limit exceeded'}), 429

    # 3. Queue job (batch_processor.py)
    job = async_queue.submit_job('3d_generation', image=image)

    # 4. Return job ID or wait for completion
    return jsonify({'job_id': job.id, 'status': 'processing'})
```

**WEBSOCKET PROGRESS UPDATES:**

```python
# Use Flask-SocketIO for real-time progress
socketio.emit('generation_progress', {
    'job_id': job_id,
    'stage': 'shape_generation',
    'progress': 45,
    'eta_seconds': 20
}, room=client_sid)
```

### [2.4] STL PROCESSING PIPELINE

**ADVANCED MESH OPERATIONS:**

```python
# backend/stl_processor.py
processor = AdvancedSTLProcessor()

# Analysis
stats = processor.analyze_stl(mesh_path)
# Returns: triangle_count, surface_area, volume, bounds, manifold_status

# Repair non-manifold geometry
repaired_mesh = processor.repair_stl(mesh)

# Optimize for 3D printing
optimized_mesh = processor.optimize_stl_for_printing(
    mesh,
    target_size_mm=100,
    wall_thickness_mm=2.0,
    supports=True
)
```

**3D EXPORT FORMATS:**

- STL: Binary format (production default)
- OBJ: With material .mtl files

### [3.3] ERROR HANDLING PATTERNS

**ERROR HANDLING PHILOSOPHY:**

1. Log comprehensive error context
2. Intelligent problem detection and classification
3. Attempt automated fixes when confidence is high
4. Graceful recovery with fallback strategies
5. Proactive problem prevention
6. Emit WebSocket error notification with diagnostics
7. Return user-friendly error message with support guidance

**ENHANCED PATTERN WITH AUTOMATED PROBLEM DETECTION:**

```python

            'error_message': str(e),
            'system_state': get_gpu_stats()
        }

        problem_detector = IntelligentProblemDetector()
        fix_result = problem_detector.auto_fix_problems([{

        }])

        if fix_result['successful_fixes']:
            logger.info("[ORFEAS] GPU OOM auto-fixed, retrying generation")
            mesh = hunyuan_processor.generate_shape(image)
        else:
            logger.warning("[ORFEAS] GPU OOM - using fallback processor")
            mesh = FallbackProcessor().generate_shape(image)

    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        # Auto-detect and fix model file issues
        error_context = {
            'error_type': 'MODEL_FILES',
            'error_message': str(e),
            'file_path': getattr(e, 'filename', 'unknown')
        }

        problem_detector = IntelligentProblemDetector()
        detection_result = problem_detector.detect_and_classify_problems(error_context)

        if detection_result['automated_fixes_available']:
            fix_result = problem_detector.auto_fix_problems(detection_result['detected_problems'])

## [5] PROJECT-SPECIFIC PATTERNS

### [5.1] HUNYUAN3D MODEL CACHING

**CRITICAL PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:**

Hunyuan3D models take 30-36 seconds to load initially. The `_model_cache` singleton pattern reduces subsequent loads to <1 second (94% speed improvement).

```python
# CORRECT: Check cache before loading
class Hunyuan3DProcessor:
    _model_cache = {'shapegen_pipeline': None, 'initialized': False}
    _cache_lock = threading.Lock()

    def __init__(self, device=None):
        with Hunyuan3DProcessor._cache_lock:
            if Hunyuan3DProcessor._model_cache['initialized']:
                # Instant load from cache
                self.shapegen_pipeline = self._model_cache['shapegen_pipeline']
                return
        self.initialize_model()  # First-time load

# WRONG: Loading models every time
def generate_3d():
    processor = Hunyuan3DProcessor()  # 30s load every request!
    return processor.generate(image)
```

### [5.2] GPU MEMORY PATTERNS

**ALWAYS clean up GPU memory after generation:**

```python
# CORRECT: Proper cleanup
def generate_3d_model(image):
    try:
        mesh = processor.generate_shape(image)
        return mesh
    finally:
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()  # CRITICAL: Free unused memory

# WRONG: Memory leak
def generate_3d_model(image):
    mesh = processor.generate_shape(image)
    return mesh  # GPU memory not released!
```

**Monitor GPU before processing:**

```python
from gpu_manager import get_gpu_manager

gpu_mgr = get_gpu_manager()
if gpu_mgr.can_process_job(estimated_vram=6000):
    with gpu_mgr.allocate_job(job_id):
        result = generate()
else:
    raise ResourceError("Insufficient GPU memory")
```

### [5.3] ASYNC JOB PATTERNS

**Long-running operations MUST use AsyncJobQueue:**

```python
# CORRECT: Async processing for 3D generation
from batch_processor import get_async_queue

async_queue = get_async_queue()
job = async_queue.submit_job(
    job_type='3d_generation',
    image=image,
    quality=7
)

# Return job ID immediately
return jsonify({'job_id': job.id, 'status': 'queued'})

# WRONG: Blocking request (30-60s timeout)
@app.route('/generate-3d')
def generate_3d():
    mesh = processor.generate_shape(image)  # Blocks for 30-60s!
    return send_file(mesh)
```

### [5.4] STL FILE HANDLING

**ALWAYS validate STL files before sending:**

```python
from stl_processor import AdvancedSTLProcessor

processor = AdvancedSTLProcessor()

# Analyze mesh quality
stats = processor.analyze_stl(mesh_path)
if not stats['manifold']:
    # Repair non-manifold geometry
    mesh = processor.repair_stl(mesh)

# Optimize for 3D printing
mesh = processor.optimize_stl_for_printing(
    mesh,
    target_size_mm=100,
    wall_thickness_mm=2.0
)

# Export with validation
mesh.export('output.stl')
```

### [5.5] MONITORING & METRICS

**Track ALL API requests and generations:**

```python
from production_metrics import track_request, GenerationTracker

@app.route('/api/generate-3d')
@track_request('generate_3d')  # Automatic request tracking
def generate_3d():
    tracker = GenerationTracker('3d_generation')
    try:
        mesh = processor.generate(image)
        tracker.success(duration=elapsed, quality=8)
    except Exception as e:
        tracker.failure(reason=str(e), duration=elapsed)
        raise
```

**Access metrics:**

- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/orfeas_admin_2025)
- Health check: http://localhost:5000/health

### [5.6] AI AGENT PATTERNS

**ENTERPRISE AGENT AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY:**

```python
from agent_auth import AgentAuthManager
from agent_security import AgentSecurityManager

auth_mgr = AgentAuthManager()
security_mgr = AgentSecurityManager()

@app.route('/api/agent/quality-check', methods=['POST'])
@security_mgr.agent_security_wrapper
def agent_quality_check():
    """Enterprise-grade agent endpoint with comprehensive security"""
    agent_id = request.headers.get('X-Agent-ID')
    api_key = request.headers.get('X-Agent-Key')
    request_signature = request.headers.get('X-Request-Signature')

    # Multi-layer authentication
    if not auth_mgr.authenticate_agent(agent_id, api_key):
        security_mgr.log_security_event('unauthorized_agent_access', agent_id)
        return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized agent'}), 401

    # Permission validation
    if not auth_mgr.check_permissions(agent_id, 'quality_assessment'):
        security_mgr.log_security_event('insufficient_permissions', agent_id)
        return jsonify({'error': 'Insufficient permissions'}), 403

    # Request signature validation for critical operations
    if not security_mgr.validate_request_signature(request, request_signature, agent_id):
        security_mgr.log_security_event('invalid_signature', agent_id)
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid request signature'}), 401

    # Rate limiting for agents
    if not auth_mgr.check_agent_rate_limits(agent_id, 'quality_assessment'):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Agent rate limit exceeded'}), 429

    return process_quality_check(request.get_json())
```

**ADVANCED AGENT ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOW:**

```python

## [6] CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINTS### [6.1] HUNYUAN3D-2.1 MODELS

**Model Location:**

```
Hunyuan3D-2.1/Hunyuan3D-2/
├ hunyuan3d-dit-v2-1/        # Shape generation (3.3GB)
├ hunyuan3d-paintpbr-v2-1/   # Texture generation (2GB)
└ hy3dgen/                   # Core generation pipelines
```

**VRAM Requirements:**

- Shape generation only: 10GB
- Texture generation only: 21GB
- Full pipeline (shape + texture): 29GB
- Model cache overhead: ~8GB (persistent)

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
HUNYUAN3D_PATH=../Hunyuan3D-2.1
DEVICE=cuda                    # auto, cuda, cpu
GPU_MEMORY_LIMIT=0.8           # 80% safety margin
XFORMERS_DISABLED=1            # Prevent DLL crash
```

### [6.2] DOCKER GPU ACCELERATION

**CRITICAL: NVIDIA Container Runtime Required**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  backend:
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

**Verify GPU access:**

```powershell
docker exec orfeas-backend-production nvidia-smi
```

### [6.3] WEBSOCKET COMMUNICATION

**Progress Updates Pattern:**

```python
# Backend: Emit progress during generation
from flask_socketio import emit

@socketio.on('start_generation')
def handle_generation(data):
    for progress in range(0, 100, 10):
        emit('generation_progress', {
            'job_id': job_id,
            'progress': progress,
            'stage': 'shape_generation',
            'eta_seconds': estimated_remaining
        })
```

```javascript
// Frontend: Listen for updates
socket.on("generation_progress", (data) => {
  updateProgressBar(data.progress);
  updateETA(data.eta_seconds);
});
```

### [6.4] FILE UPLOAD VALIDATION

**Security-Critical Patterns:**

```python
from validation import FileUploadValidator

validator = FileUploadValidator()

# ALWAYS validate before processing
image = validator.validate_image(request.files['file'])
# Checks: file type, size, dimensions, malicious content

# NEVER trust user input
filename = secure_filename(request.files['file'].filename)
```

**Allowed formats:**

- Images: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP
- 3D models: STL, OBJ, PLY, GLTF, FBX
- Max size: 50MB (configurable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)

# Flask middleware for automatic context building
from flask import g

@app.before_request
def build_request_context():
    """Build context for every request automatically"""

    if not hasattr(g, 'context'):
        request_data = {
            'endpoint': request.endpoint,
            'method': request.method,
            'user_agent': request.headers.get('User-Agent'),
            'ip_address': request.remote_addr,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        }

        # Add file data if present
        if request.files:
            request_data['files'] = {
                name: {
                    'filename': file.filename,
                    'size': len(file.read()),
                    'content_type': file.content_type
                } for name, file in request.files.items()
            }
            # Reset file streams
            for file in request.files.values():
                file.seek(0)

        # Build comprehensive context
        g.context = context_manager.build_processing_context(request_data)
        g.recommendations = context_manager.get_contextual_recommendations(g.context)

@app.after_request
def update_context_learning(response):
    """Update context learning based on request outcome"""

    if hasattr(g, 'context') and hasattr(g, 'processing_result'):
        # Update learning based on request success/failure
        success = response.status_code < 400

        learning_data = {
            'context': g.context,
            'success': success,
            'status_code': response.status_code,
            'processing_time': getattr(g, 'processing_time', 0),
            'response_size': len(response.get_data())
        }

        context_manager.update_learning(learning_data)

    return response
```

**CONTEXT-BASED MONITORING:**

```python
# Enhanced monitoring with context awareness
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Context-aware metrics
context_processing_time = Histogram(
    'context_processing_seconds',
    'Time spent on context processing',
    ['context_type', 'complexity_level']
)

context_accuracy = Gauge(
    'context_prediction_accuracy',
    'Accuracy of context-based predictions',
    ['prediction_type']
)

context_cache_hits = Counter(
    'context_cache_hits_total',
    'Number of context cache hits',
    ['cache_type']
)

def track_context_performance(func):
    """Decorator to track context-aware performance"""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        context = g.get('context', {})
        complexity = context.get('input_analysis', {}).get('complexity_score', 0)

        complexity_level = 'simple' if complexity < 0.3 else 'medium' if complexity < 0.7 else 'complex'

        with context_processing_time.labels(
            context_type=context.get('input_analysis', {}).get('input_type', 'unknown'),
            complexity_level=complexity_level
        ).time():
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        return result
    return wrapper
```
