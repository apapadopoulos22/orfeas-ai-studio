# Negative Image Texture Fix# Negative Image Texture Fix - Summary# Negative Image Texture Fix - Summary

## Issue

User reported: "it generate negative image in a cube"## Issue## Issue

Models displayed inverted or incorrect textures on the cube instead of actual image colors.

## Root CauseUser reported: "it generate negative image in a cube"User reported: "it generate negative image in a cube"

Bug in `backend/hunyuan_integration.py` in the `image_to_3d_generation()` method:

The code converted image to RGBA immediately, then checked if it was RGB:The 3D models were being generated with inverted or incorrect textures displayed on the cube instead of the actual image colors.The 3D models were being generated with inverted or incorrect textures displayed on the cube instead of the actual image colors.

```python

image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGBA")

if image.mode == 'RGB' and self.rembg is not None:## Root Cause Analysis## Root Cause Analysis

    image = self.rembg(image)

```

**Problem:** After `.convert("RGBA")`, the mode is always "RGBA", never "RGB". Background removal never executed, causing texture issues.The bug was in the `image_to_3d_generation()` method in `backend/hunyuan_integration.py`:The bug was in the `image_to_3d_generation()` method in `backend/hunyuan_integration.py`:

## Solution

Reordered the image processing to handle conversions correctly:### The Bug### The Bug

```python

# Load image as-is

image = Image.open(image_path)The original code converted the image to RGBA immediately, then checked if it was RGB to apply background removal:The original code converted the image to RGBA immediately, then checked if it was RGB to apply background removal:



# Convert to RGB first

if image.mode != 'RGB':

    image = image.convert("RGB")```python```python



# Remove background BEFORE other conversionsimage = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGBA")  # Converts to 4 channelsimage = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGBA")  # ← Converts to 4 channels

if self.rembg is not None:

    image = self.rembg(image)



# Convert to RGBA for Hunyuan3Dif image.mode == 'RGB' and self.rembg is not None:  # Checks for 3 channelsif image.mode == 'RGB' and self.rembg is not None:  # ← Checks for 3 channels

if image.mode != 'RGBA':

    image = image.convert("RGBA")    image = self.rembg(image)  # This NEVER executes!    image = self.rembg(image)  # ← This NEVER executes!



# Generate 3D mesh``````

mesh = self.shapegen_pipeline(image=image)[0]

```

## What Changed**Why this is wrong:****Why this is wrong:**

- `backend/hunyuan_integration.py` - Lines 273-298

- Image conversion order corrected

- Proper pipeline: RGB → RemoveBG → RGBA → Generation1. After `.convert("RGBA")`, the image mode is always "RGBA" (4 channels)1. After `.convert("RGBA")`, the image mode is always "RGBA" (4 channels)

## Results2. The condition `image.mode == 'RGB'` is never true2. The condition `image.mode == 'RGB'` is never true

- ✅ Correct texture mapping on 3D models3. Background removal is skipped, even if rembg is available3. Background removal is skipped, even if rembg is available

- ✅ No more negative/inverted images

- ✅ Background removal now works4. The raw, unprocessed image is fed to Hunyuan3D4. The raw, unprocessed image is fed to Hunyuan3D

- ✅ Proper color representation

5. This causes texture mapping issues and inverted/negative appearance5. This causes texture mapping issues and inverted/negative appearance

## Testing

1. Start server: `.\START_SERVER.bat`

2. Open: `http://localhost:5000/studio`## The Fix## The Fix

3. Upload test image with distinct colors

4. Generate 3D model

5. Verify texture matches input (not inverted)

**Fix Date:** October 22, 2025

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Validated```python```python

image = Image.open(image_path)# Step 1: Load image as-is

image = Image.open(image_path)

# Step 1: Convert to RGB (required by rembg and Hunyuan3D)

if image.mode != 'RGB':# Step 2: Convert to RGB (required by both rembg and Hunyuan3D)

    image = image.convert("RGB")if image.mode != 'RGB':

    image = image.convert("RGB")

# Step 2: Remove background BEFORE other conversions

if self.rembg is not None:# Step 3: Remove background BEFORE other conversions

    image = self.rembg(image)if self.rembg is not None:

    image = self.rembg(image)

# Step 3: Convert to RGBA for Hunyuan3D (proper channel format)

if image.mode != 'RGBA':# Step 4: Convert to RGBA for Hunyuan3D (proper channel format)

    image = image.convert("RGBA")if image.mode != 'RGBA':

    image = image.convert("RGBA")

# Step 4: Generate 3D mesh with properly prepared image

mesh = self.shapegen_pipeline[image=image](0)# Step 5: Generate 3D mesh with properly prepared image

```mesh = self.shapegen_pipeline(image=image)[0]

**Why this works:**

- Step 1: Ensures uniform color space for processing

- Step 2: Background removal works because we have RGB- Step 2: Ensures uniform color space for processing
