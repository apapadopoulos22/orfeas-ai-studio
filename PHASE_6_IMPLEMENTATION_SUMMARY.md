## PHASE 6D: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION ✓ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Code quality and performance optimization strategy
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Code Quality Analysis

#### main.py Assessment

- **Lines of code:** 4,610
- **Functions:** 103
- **Classes:** 5
- **Issues found:** 2

**Main Issue:** File is extremely large (>2000 lines)

- **Impact:** Difficult to maintain, test, and understand
- **Recommendation:** Split into modular components

#### Code Quality Tools Status

- ✓ Black (code formatter) - installed
- ✓ Pylint (linter) - installed
- ✓ MyPy (type checker) - installed
- ✓ Flake8 (style guide) - installed

### Caching Strategy

Three-tier caching implementation plan:

#### Tier 1: Request Result Caching (LOW effort, HIGH impact)

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_model_info(model_name: str):
    return expensive_model_info_retrieval(model_name)

```text

- **Benefit:** 10-50x faster for repeated requests
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Target:** Implement in Phase 6C

#### Tier 2: Generation Result Deduplication (MEDIUM effort, VERY HIGH impact)

```python
def generate_3d(prompt: str, style: str):
    cache_key = hash(f"{prompt}:{style}")
    if cache_key in cache:
        return cache[cache_key]  # 100-150x speedup!
    result = expensive_generation(prompt, style)
    cache[cache_key] = result
    return result

```text

- **Benefit:** 100-150x speedup for identical requests
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours
- **Priority:** HIGH

#### Tier 3: Distributed Cache (HIGH effort, future)

- Redis integration for multi-instance coordination
- Priority: MEDIUM (Phase 7)
