## Your 3D Model Files- Professional CAD software

- Free for personal/educational use

All generated models are STL files (Stereolithography format):- Full 3D design capabilities

- Export to manufacturing formats

- Format: `.stl` (binary or ASCII)

- Size: Typically 20-40 MB## Fixing WebGL Support (Optional)

- Location: Your browser's download folder

- Compatibility: Works with all major 3D softwareIf you want to try enabling WebGL in your browser:

## Quality Assurance### Chrome/Edge

- ✅ Model generated with Hunyuan3D-2.11. Type in address bar: `chrome://flags` (or `edge://flags`)

- ✅ True volumetric 3D geometry (not 2.5D)2. Search for "WebGL"

- ✅ Proper texture mapping3. Enable "WebGL 2.0"

- ✅ Ready for professional use4. Restart browser

## Troubleshooting### Firefox

**File won't open in viewer:**1. Type in address bar: `about:config`

2. Search for "webgl.disabled"

- Verify the file downloaded completely3. Set to `false`

- Try a different viewer4. Restart browser

- Check file isn't corrupted (should be 20+ MB)

### Internet Explorer / Old Browsers
