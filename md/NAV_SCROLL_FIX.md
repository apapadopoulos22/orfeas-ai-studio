# Navigation Container Scroll Fix

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Issue:** Navigation container not scrolling with page content

## # # Status:**[OK]**FIXED

---

## # # [TARGET] Problem

The navigation bar was using `position: sticky` which kept it fixed at the top of the viewport. User requested it to scroll naturally with the page content.

---

## # # [OK] Solution Applied

## # # Changed in `orfeas-studio.html`

**Line 28:** Changed navigation header positioning

## # # BEFORE

```css
.header {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  backdrop-filter: blur(15px);
  border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  padding: 1rem 0;
  position: sticky; /* [FAIL] Kept at top */
  top: 0;
  z-index: 100;
}

```text

## # # AFTER

```css
.header {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  backdrop-filter: blur(15px);
  border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  padding: 1rem 0;
  position: relative; /* [OK] Scrolls with page */
  z-index: 100;
}

```text

## # # [ART] Behavior Changes

- Navigation always visible

## # # After Fix

- When scrolling down, navigation moves up with content
- Natural document flow behavior

---

## # # [OK] Verification

Test the fix by:

## # # [TARGET] Additional Notes
