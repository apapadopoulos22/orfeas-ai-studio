# ORFEAS AI Studio - Local HTTP Server

## # # [LAUNCH] Quick Start

Run the local HTTP server to test full PWA features:

## # # Windows PowerShell

```powershell
.\START_HTTP_SERVER.ps1

```text

## # # Windows Command Prompt / Double-Click

```text
START_HTTP_SERVER.bat

```text

## # # [SIGNAL] Server Details

- **Port:** 8080
- **Host:** localhost
- **Auto-opens:** http://localhost:8080/orfeas-studio.html

## # # [TARGET] Available URLs

## # # Main Application

- **ORFEAS Studio:** http://localhost:8080/orfeas-studio.html

## # # Test Suites

- **Phase 9 Tests (PWA Foundation):** http://localhost:8080/test-orfeas-phase9-optimizations.html
- **Phase 10 Tests (PWA Integration):** http://localhost:8080/test-orfeas-phase10-optimizations.html

## # # [OK] PWA Features Enabled

When running via HTTP server (not file://), you get:

[OK] **Service Worker Registration** - Offline support and caching
[OK] **Install Prompt** - `beforeinstallprompt` event fires
[OK] **Offline Caching** - Assets cached for offline use
[OK] **Background Sync** - Queue operations when offline
[OK] **Push Notifications** - Desktop notifications support

## # # [CONFIG] Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** (for `http.server` module)
- Available on PATH

## # # Check Python Installation

```powershell
python --version

```text

If Python is not installed, download from: https://www.python.org/

## # # [STOP] Stop Server

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop the server.

## # #  Troubleshooting

## # # Port 8080 Already in Use

The script automatically attempts to kill existing processes on port 8080.

If manual intervention needed:

```powershell

## Find process using port 8080

Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080 | Select-Object OwningProcess

## Kill the process

Stop-Process -Id <ProcessID> -Force

```text

## # # Python Not Found

Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH:

1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/

2. During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

3. Restart terminal

## # # Browser Doesn't Auto-Open

Manually navigate to:

```text
http://localhost:8080/orfeas-studio.html

```text

## # # [ART] PWA Install Prompt

After loading the page via HTTP server:

1. Wait 3 seconds for install banner to appear

2. Click **"Install"** button

3. ORFEAS Studio installs as desktop app

4. Enjoy offline-capable, native-like experience!

## # # [STATS] Testing PWA Features

## # # Test Service Worker

2. Open DevTools (F12) â†’ Application tab

3. Check "Service Workers" section

4. Should show registered service worker

## # # Test Install Prompt

## # # [ORFEAS] Performance Benefits

Running via HTTP server vs file:// protocol:

- **Service Worker:** [OK] Works ([FAIL] blocked on file://)
- **Install Prompt:** [OK] Fires ([FAIL] never fires on file://)
- **Caching:** [OK] Active ([FAIL] disabled on file://)
- **CORS:** [OK] No issues ([FAIL] blocks fetch on file://)
- **PWA Installability:** [OK] Full support ([FAIL] not installable on file://)
