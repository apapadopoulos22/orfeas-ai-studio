# ORFEAS AI 2Dâ†’3D Studio - TQM Quality Audit Reference

This document provides reference patterns and implementation notes for Total Quality Management (TQM) audit integration, as recommended in the copilot-instructions.

## 1. Continuous Quality Monitoring

- Integrate `ContinuousQualityMonitor` for real-time metrics and alerting.
- Track performance, reliability, security, and compliance metrics.
- Reference: See TQM audit patterns in copilot-instructions section 4.3.1.

## 2. Automated Quality Audits

- Use `AutomatedAuditScheduler` to schedule daily, weekly, and monthly audits.
- Generate executive reports and trigger improvement actions if thresholds are not met.
- Reference: See audit scheduling and reporting patterns.

## 3. Quality Gate Enforcement

- Add middleware to enforce quality thresholds before/after requests.
- Trigger automated corrections if quality drops below target.
- Reference: See QualityGatewayMiddleware pattern.

## 4. Metrics and Reporting

- Use Prometheus metrics for audit counts, quality scores, and improvement durations.
- Reference: See metrics integration patterns.

## 5. Documentation

- Update this file with new audit patterns and lessons learned as TQM evolves.
