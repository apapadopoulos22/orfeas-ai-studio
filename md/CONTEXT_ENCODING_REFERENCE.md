## ORFEAS AI 2D→3D Studio - Context & Encoding Reference

This document summarizes the implementation and reference patterns for intelligent context handling and multi-encoding support, as recommended in the copilot-instructions.

## 1. Intelligent Context Handling

- Use `IntelligentContextManager` to build and manage processing context for all requests.
- Integrate context-aware model selection and error handling.
- Reference: See context manager and model selector patterns.

## 2. Contextual Agent Coordination

- Use `ContextualAgentCoordinator` to share context across agents and coordinate workflows.
- Reference: See agent coordination patterns.

## 3. Context Persistence & Learning

- Use `ContextPersistenceManager` to persist context and learn from historical data.
- Reference: See context persistence and learning patterns.

## 4. Multi-Encoding Support

- Use `EncodingManager` for encoding detection, normalization, and conversion.
- Integrate with Flask request hooks for input normalization.
- Reference: See encoding activation protocols and batch utility patterns.

## 5. Internationalization (i18n)

- Use `InternationalizationManager` for language detection and multilingual processing.
- Reference: See i18n manager and language detection patterns.

## 6. Documentation

- Update this file as new context and encoding features are implemented.
