## # #  BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS

## # # 1. Shape Generation (CRITICAL - 99.4%)

**Problem:** The Hunyuan3D shape generation stage takes almost all the time:

- **124 seconds average**
- **99.4% of total pipeline time**
- Includes:

  - Diffusion sampling: ~50 steps
  - Volume decoding: 7134 steps
  - Torch compilation overhead

## # # Evidence from Logs

```text
Diffusion Sampling:: 100%|| 50/50 [00:22<00:00]  ← 22 seconds
Volume Decoding: 100%|| 7134/7134 [00:52<00:00] ← 52 seconds

```text

## # # Root Causes

1. **50 inference steps** - Can potentially reduce to 40 without quality loss

2. **7134 volume decoding steps** - Seems fixed by model architecture

3. **Torch compiler warnings** - C++ compiler not found, falling back to slower path

4. **CUDA Graph warnings** - "The CUDA Graph is empty" (16 times!)
5. **Low GPU utilization** - Only 24.8% GPU usage despite CUDA available

## # # 2. GPU Utilization (25% - Severely Underutilized)

**Problem:** GPU only 25% utilized during generation:

- **GPU Utilization:** 24.8%
- **VRAM Usage:** 4927MB / 24575MB (20%)
- **Target Utilization:** 85%

## # # Why This Matters

- RTX 3090 has 24GB VRAM but we're only using 5GB
- GPU is mostly idle waiting for CPU operations
- Could process 3-4× more work concurrently

---

## # #  OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

## # # Priority 1: Critical (Shape Generation - 51.9% improvement needed)

## # # A. Reduce Inference Steps (Expected: 10-15% faster)

```python

## Current: 50 steps

num_inference_steps=50

## Optimized: 40 steps

num_inference_steps=40

```text

**Impact:** 10-15% speedup (12-19s saved)
**Risk:** Minimal quality impact based on Hunyuan3D documentation

## # # B. Fix Torch Compiler Issues (Expected: 5-10% faster)

```bash

## Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools

## Or set environment variable to disable inductor

set TORCH_INDUCTOR_DISABLE=1

```text

**Impact:** 5-10% speedup (6-12s saved)
**Risk:** None - fallback to eager mode

## # # C. Fix CUDA Graph Warnings (Expected: 10-15% faster)

The 16 "CUDA Graph is empty" warnings indicate inefficient GPU kernel launches.

## # # Fix

```python

## Ensure torch.cuda.graphs are properly initialized

import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
torch.cuda.synchronize()

```text

**Impact:** 10-15% speedup (12-19s saved)
**Risk:** None - proper CUDA usage

## # # D. Increase Batch Size for Volume Decoding (Expected: 20-30% faster)

7134 volume decoding steps could be batched more aggressively.

**Fix:** Investigate `batch_size` parameter in volume decoder config
**Impact:** 20-30% speedup (25-37s saved)
**Risk:** Medium - requires testing for quality impact

## # # E. Enable Aggressive GPU Caching (Expected: 5-10% faster)

```python

## Cache compiled CUDA kernels

os.environ["TORCH_CUDNN_BENCHMARK"] = "1"
os.environ["TORCH_CUDNN_V8_API_ENABLED"] = "1"

```text

**Impact:** 5-10% speedup after first run
**Risk:** None

## # # Priority 2: GPU Utilization (Increase from 25% → 85%)

## # # A. Concurrent Job Processing

```python

## Process 3 jobs in parallel instead of 1

MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS = 3  # Currently set to 3 but not being used?

```text

**Impact:** 3× throughput
**Risk:** None - GPU has capacity

## # # B. Async Batch Processing

Already implemented in `batch_processor.py` but may not be engaged during profiling.

**Action:** Ensure batch processing is enabled for production workloads

---

## # #  OPTIMIZATION ROADMAP

## # # Phase 1: Quick Wins (Expected: 35-50% improvement)

1. Reduce inference steps 50 → 40 (10-15%)

2. Fix CUDA graph warnings (10-15%)

3. Enable torch.cudnn.benchmark (5-10%)

4. Set TORCH_INDUCTOR_DISABLE=1 (5-10%)

**Expected Result:** 124.62s → **62-81s** (target: <60s)

## # # Phase 2: Advanced (Expected: Additional 10-20%)

1. Optimize volume decoder batch size (20-30%)

2. Profile and optimize individual CUDA kernels

**Expected Result:** 62-81s → **50-73s** (comfortably under 60s target)

## # # Phase 3: Concurrency (3× throughput)

1. Enable concurrent job processing

2. GPU utilization 25% → 85%

**Expected Result:** Handle 3 jobs simultaneously instead of 1

## # #  TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

## # # Why Shape Generation Dominates

1. **Diffusion Models Are Computationally Intensive**

- 50 inference steps through UNet
- Each step processes high-resolution latent space
- Requires multiple attention layers

1. **Volume Decoding Is Sequential**

- 7134 volume decoding steps
- Can't be easily parallelized due to dependencies
- Decodes 3D voxel grid to mesh

1. **Torch Compilation Overhead**

- C++ compiler not found
- Fallback to slower Python interpreter path
- CUDA graphs not being utilized

## # # High Variance Explained

## # # Run 1: 167.35s (slow)

- First run after model loading
- Torch compiling CUDA kernels
- Cold cache

## # # Run 2: 81.89s (faster)

- Warm cache
- Compiled kernels reused
- Better GPU utilization

**Conclusion:** Caching works but initial run is slow. Need consistent performance.
