## # #  DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## # # **Step 1: Restart Grafana to Load New Dashboard**

## # # If using Docker Compose

```powershell
cd c:\Users\johng\Documents\Erevus\orfeas\backend\monitoring_stack
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

```text

## # # If using standalone Grafana

```powershell

## Restart Grafana service (Windows)

Restart-Service grafana

## Or manually restart Grafana application

```text

## # # **Step 2: Access Grafana Dashboard**

1. Open browser: http://localhost:3000

2. Login: `admin` / `orfeas_admin_2025`

3. Navigate to: Dashboards → ORFEAS AI 2D→3D Studio - Production Monitoring

4. Scroll down to see new quality panels starting at row 32

## # # **Step 3: Verify Quality Metrics**

## # # Check if metrics are flowing

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics | grep quality

```text

## # # Expected output

```text
quality_overall_score 0.89
quality_bg_removal_score 0.92
quality_shape_score 0.88
quality_texture_score 0.85
quality_final_score 0.90
quality_manifold_rate 85.0
quality_printable_rate 80.0
quality_auto_repairs_total{repair_type="fill_holes"} 12
quality_grade_total{grade="A"} 5

```text

## # # If no data appears

- Backend must be running with quality validation enabled
- Generate at least 1 3D model to populate metrics
- Wait 10 seconds for Grafana to scrape Prometheus

## # # **Step 4: Generate Test Data**

Upload a test image to populate the quality panels:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/generate-3d \

  -F "image=@test_image.png" \
  -F "format=glb" \
  -F "quality=7"

```text

Watch backend logs for `[QUALITY]` events:

```text
[QUALITY] Background removal score: 0.920
[QUALITY] Shape generation score: 0.880, manifold: True
[QUALITY] Texture coherence score: 0.850
[QUALITY] Final mesh score: 0.900
[QUALITY] Overall score: 0.890 (A)

```text

Refresh Grafana dashboard to see panels update!

## # #  USING THE QUALITY DASHBOARD

## # # **Monitoring Real-Time Quality**

**Panel 15 (Overall Gauge)** - Quick glance at current generation quality:

- Blue (95-100%): Exceptional quality, celebrate!
- Green (80-94%): Good quality, production ready
- Yellow (70-79%): Acceptable, but investigate if persistent
- Red (<70%): Poor quality, needs immediate attention

**Panel 16 (Stage Scores)** - Diagnose which stage has issues:

- Low BG score → Check background removal model
- Low Shape score → Check Hunyuan3D shape generation
- Low Texture score → Check texture model or input image quality
- Low Final score → Check mesh post-processing

## # # **Identifying Trends**

**Panel 19 (Quality Trend)** - Watch for degradation:

- Declining trend → Model performance issue or input quality dropping
- Stable high scores → System performing well
- Spiky pattern → Inconsistent input quality

**Panel 24 (Threshold Passes)** - Monitor quality distribution:

- Increasing A+ passes → Quality improving over time
- Decreasing B+ passes → Quality degrading, investigate

## # # **Auto-Repair Analysis**

**Panel 17 (Total Repairs)** - Volume of repairs:

- 0-10 repairs: Normal operation
- 10-50 repairs: Moderate mesh issues
- 50+ repairs: High frequency, check shape generation quality

**Panel 22 (Repair Breakdown)** - Identify specific issues:

- High "fill_holes" → Non-manifold geometry common
- High "fix_normals" → Normal calculation issues
- High "remove_degenerate" → Shape generation quality problem

## # # **Quality Distribution Analysis**

**Panel 20 (Heatmap)** - Understand score patterns:

- Concentrated around 0.9-1.0 → Excellent consistency
- Spread across 0.5-1.0 → Inconsistent quality
- Peak at 0.6-0.7 → Most generations mediocre

**Panel 21 (Grade Pie Chart)** - Overall quality breakdown:

- 80%+ A/A+ grades → High-quality system
- 50%+ B grades → Acceptable but improvable
- 30%+ C/D grades → Quality issues need addressing

## # # **Alerting & Proactive Monitoring**

**Panel 23 (Validation Failures)** has built-in alert:

- Triggers when failures exceed 5/sec
- Indicates sudden model degradation or attack
- Check backend logs for failure reasons

**Recommended Alert Actions**:

1. Check recent code deployments

2. Verify model integrity (checksums)

3. Review recent input images for anomalies

4. Check GPU memory availability

---

## # #  QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WORKFLOW

## # # **Weekly Quality Review**

1. **Check Panel 21 (Grade Distribution)**:

- Target: 70%+ A/A+ grades
- If below target: Investigate using Panel 16 (stage scores)

1. **Review Panel 24 (Threshold Passes)**:

- Trend should be stable or increasing
- Declining trend requires root cause analysis

1. **Analyze Panel 22 (Repair Breakdown)**:

- High repair volume → Shape generation needs tuning
- Document common repair types for model improvements

## # # **Quality Incident Response**

## # # Scenario 1: Sudden Quality Drop

1. Check Panel 15 (Overall Gauge) → Confirm drop severity

2. Check Panel 16 (Stage Scores) → Identify failing stage

3. Check Panel 23 (Validation Failures) → Look for spike in failures

4. Review backend logs for [QUALITY] warnings
5. Check recent deployments or configuration changes

## # # Scenario 2: High Auto-Repair Frequency

1. Check Panel 17 (Total Repairs) → Confirm high volume

2. Check Panel 22 (Repair Breakdown) → Identify dominant type

3. Check Panel 19 (Shape Score Trend) → See if shape quality declining

4. Test with known-good input images
5. Consider adjusting shape generation parameters

## # # Scenario 3: Inconsistent Quality

1. Check Panel 20 (Heatmap) → Visualize distribution spread

2. Check Panel 19 (Trend) → Look for erratic patterns

3. Analyze input image characteristics (complexity, size, format)

4. Check GPU memory availability (could cause quality variance)

## # #  CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

## # # **Adjusting Time Ranges**

Edit `grafana-dashboard.json` time settings:

```json
"time": {
  "from": "now-1h",   // Change to "now-6h" for longer view
  "to": "now"
},
"refresh": "10s"      // Change to "5s" for faster updates

```text

## # # **Adding Custom Thresholds**

Modify panel thresholds to match your quality standards:

```json
"thresholds": {
  "steps": [
    {"value": 0, "color": "red"},
    {"value": 75, "color": "yellow"},   // Raise from 70
    {"value": 85, "color": "green"}     // Raise from 80
  ]
}

```text

## # # **Creating Custom Alerts**

Add alerts to any panel by adding:

```json
"alert": {
  "name": "Low Shape Quality",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "evaluator": {"type": "lt", "params": [0.80]},
      "query": {"params": ["A", "5m", "now"]},
