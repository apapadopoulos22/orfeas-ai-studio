# [TARGET] SESSION 6 - COMPLETE SUCCESS SUMMARY

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Session:** #6 - Backend Reliability & System Audit

## # # Status:**[OK]**100% SUCCESS - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## # # [ORFEAS] CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED

## # # **THE PROBLEM:**

"Server fail to start" - Backend appeared to fail during automated startup

## # # **THE ROOT CAUSE:**

**Port Configuration Mismatch** - NOT a timeout issue!

- [OK] Backend runs on port **5000**
- [FAIL] Startup scripts checked port **5002**
- Result: Health checks always failed → Scripts assumed backend was dead

## # # **THE FIX:**

Updated 3 critical files to use correct port:

1. `frontend_server.py` - Port 5002 → 5000

2. `orfeas_service.py` - Port 5002 → 5000

3. `START_ORFEAS_AUTO.ps1` - All references 5002 → 5000

**Plus:** Increased timeouts from 30s → 45s (safety margin for model loading)

---

## # # [OK] VERIFICATION TESTS - ALL PASSED

## # # **Test 1: Automated Startup**

```powershell
.\START_ORFEAS_AUTO.ps1

```text

**Result:** [OK] Backend started on port 5000 (PID: 6512)

---

## # # **Test 2: Port Verification**

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

```text

**Result:** [OK] Port 5000 listening and active

---

## # # **Test 3: Health Check**

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health

```text

**Result:** [OK] 200 OK - GPU available, all capabilities active

---

## # # **Test 4: Complete Workflow**

```powershell
cd backend; python test_complete_workflow.py

```text

## # # Result:**[OK]**100% SUCCESS RATE (8/8 tests passed)

## # # [METRICS] BEFORE vs AFTER COMPARISON

## # # **BEFORE SESSION 6:**

| Issue              | Status     | Impact                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Automated Startup  | [FAIL] FAILED  | High - Required manual intervention    |
| Port Configuration | [FAIL] WRONG   | Critical - Health checks always failed |
| Timeout Values     | [WARN] UNKNOWN | Medium - Not documented                |
| Duplicate Files    | [WARN] UNKNOWN | Low - Disk space waste                 |
| Workflow Test      | [OK] PASSED  | Note - Only worked with manual startup |

**User Experience:** Confusing, required debugging knowledge, unreliable
