## # # [LAUNCH] HOW TO USE THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE

## # # **1. Running Tests (pytest)**

```powershell

## Navigate to backend directory

cd backend

## Run all tests

pytest tests/ -v

## Run specific test category

pytest tests/ -v -m integration      # Integration tests only
pytest tests/ -v -m security         # Security tests only
pytest tests/ -v -m "not slow"       # Skip slow tests

## Run with coverage

pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

## Run in parallel (faster)

pytest tests/ -n auto                # Auto-detect CPU cores

## Generate HTML report

pytest tests/ --html=test-report.html --self-contained-html

```text

## # # Install test dependencies first

```powershell
pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt

```text

---

## # # **2. Starting Monitoring Stack (Docker)**

```powershell

## Navigate to monitoring stack

cd backend/monitoring_stack

## Start Prometheus + Grafana

docker-compose up -d

## View logs

docker-compose logs -f

## Stop monitoring

docker-compose down

## Stop and remove volumes (full cleanup)

docker-compose down -v

```text

## # # Access dashboards

- **Prometheus:** http://localhost:9090
- **Grafana:** http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)

---

## # # **3. Integrating Monitoring in main.py**

Add to your `backend/main.py`:

```python
from monitoring import setup_monitoring, track_request_metrics

## Setup monitoring endpoints

setup_monitoring(app)

## Add decorators to endpoints

@app.route('/upload-image', methods=['POST'])
@track_request_metrics('/upload-image')
def upload_image():

    # ... existing code ...

```text

## # # Install monitoring dependencies

```powershell
pip install prometheus-client psutil

```text

---

## # # **4. GitHub Actions (Automatic)**

## # # GitHub Actions runs automatically on

- Every push to `main` or `develop`
- Every pull request
- Manual workflow dispatch

## # # View results

- GitHub repo → Actions tab
- See test results, coverage, security scans
- Download test reports as artifacts

## # # Setup (one-time)

1. Push code to GitHub

2. GitHub Actions will auto-detect `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

3. First run happens automatically

## # # Optional: Add Codecov badge to README

```text
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/orfeas/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/orfeas)

```text

---

## # #  REMAINING MANUAL STEPS

## # # **Recommended Actions:**

1. **Install Test Dependencies:**

   ```powershell
   cd backend
   pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt

   ```text

1. **Run Test Suite (Verify):**

   ```powershell

   # Make sure server is running first

   python backend/main.py

   # In another terminal:

   cd backend
   pytest tests/ -v -m "not slow"

   ```text

1. **Start Monitoring (Optional):**

   ```powershell
   cd backend/monitoring_stack
   docker-compose up -d

   # Visit http://localhost:3000 (Grafana)

   # Login: admin/admin

   ```text

1. **Integrate Monitoring in Code:**

- Add `from monitoring import setup_monitoring` to `main.py`
- Call `setup_monitoring(app)` after Flask app creation
- Visit `/metrics` endpoint to verify

1. **Update README.md:**

- Document new test structure
- Add monitoring setup instructions
- Add CI/CD badge
