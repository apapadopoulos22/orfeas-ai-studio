## Warning 1: torchvision Image Extension

```
UserWarning: Failed to load image Python extension:
'[WinError 127] The specified procedure could not be found'
```

### What it means

- torchvision couldn't load its native image processing library (`libjpeg`/`libpng`)
- This is a Windows-specific issue with compiled binary extensions

### Impact: **NONE** ✅

- The system falls back to PIL/Pillow for image handling
- All image operations still work correctly
- This is expected on Windows systems

### Should you fix it?

**No** - This warning is harmless. Only fix if you specifically need torchvision's native image functions (you don't).

## Warning 2: Model Download

```
Model path not exists, try to download from huggingface
```

### What it means

- The Hunyuan3D model isn't cached locally
- System is downloading from HuggingFace Hub (~4.59GB)

### Impact: **EXPECTED** ✅

- First startup will take 2-5 minutes
- Subsequent runs will use cached model (instant)

### What to expect

```
[INFO] Fetching 6 files: 100%|████| 6/6 [00:XX<?, ?it/s]
[INFO] Loading model from C:\Users\johng\.cache\huggingface\hub\...
[INFO] Model loaded successfully
```

## Complete Startup Flow

```
1. [WARN] torchvision image extension - SAFE TO IGNORE
   └─ Falls back to PIL automatically

2. [INFO] Model path not exists, downloading...
   └─ Normal on first run (~5 min)

3. [INFO] Loading model from cache...
   └─ Model initialization in progress

4. [SUCCESS] Model loaded successfully
   └─ Server ready for requests

5. * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   └─ Server is ready!
```

## If You See These Messages - Everything is Normal

✅ `UserWarning: Failed to load image Python extension` → Safe warning
✅ `Model path not exists, try to download` → Expected on first run
✅ `Loading model from huggingface` → Downloading AI model
✅ `Model loaded successfully` → Model ready
✅ `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000` → Server online

---

## Real Errors (These Would Be Problems)

❌ `ModuleNotFoundError` → Missing Python package
❌ `CUDA out of memory` → GPU RAM issue
❌ `FileNotFoundError: main.py` → Incorrect directory
❌ `Address already in use` → Port 5000 taken
❌ `[ERROR] Model loading failed` → Actual model problem

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for model download** (if first run)
2. **Open browser** → `http://localhost:5000`
3. **Check health** → Click "Status" button in UI
4. **Upload test image** → Try 3D generation
5. **Monitor logs** → `backend\logs\backend_requests.log`

---

**Bottom line:** Your server is working correctly. These warnings are normal and safe. Proceed with testing! 🚀
