## Verification Steps Performed

1. Pattern Matching: Comprehensive emoji Unicode range detection

   - Emoticons (U+1F600-U+1F64F)
   - Symbols & Pictographs (U+1F300-U+1F5FF)
   - Transport & Map Symbols (U+1F680-U+1F6FF)
   - All other Unicode emoji ranges

2. File Type Coverage:

   - All documentation files
   - All source code files
   - All configuration files
   - All utility scripts

3. Character Count Validation:

   - Pre-processing content length recorded
   - Post-processing content length verified
   - Only modified if changes detected

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Build Process**

   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\johng\Documents\oscar
   python -m py_compile backend/*.py

   ```text

2. **Test Deployment**

   - Run application to verify no emoji-dependent code exists
   - Check documentation renders correctly

3. **Git Commit** (Optional)

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove all emojis from project files (1788 files, 720K chars)"

   ```text
   ```

4. **Archive Old Version** (Optional)
   - Backup original if needed before cleanup
