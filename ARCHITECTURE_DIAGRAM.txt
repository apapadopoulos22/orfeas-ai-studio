    (User chooses preferred method)


3D VIEWER ARCHITECTURE (Three Layers)
======================================

LAYER 1: THREE.JS (Primary)
├─ Target: WebGL-capable browsers
├─ Performance: 60 FPS, instant
├─ Features: Full controls, auto-rotate
├─ When Used: Browser supports WebGL
└─ Fallback: Tries Layer 2 on failure

LAYER 2: 3DVIEWER.NET IFRAME (Fallback 1)
├─ Target: WebGL unavailable / older browsers
├─ Performance: 30-60 FPS, 1-2s load
├─ Features: Professional viewer, touch support
├─ When Used: Three.js fails
└─ Fallback: Provides Layer 3 option

LAYER 3: DOWNLOAD (Fallback 2)
├─ Target: Professional software / offline use
├─ Performance: Instant download
├─ Features: Full compatibility
├─ When Used: Always available
└─ Next Step: Open with preferred software


BROWSER COMPATIBILITY MATRIX
=============================

         Three.js  iframe  Download
Chrome     ✅       ✅       ✅   → FULL SUPPORT
Edge       ✅       ✅       ✅   → FULL SUPPORT
Firefox    ✅       ✅       ✅   → FULL SUPPORT
Safari     ✅       ✅       ✅   → FULL SUPPORT
IE 11      ❌       ✅       ✅   → PARTIAL (fallback)
Mobile     ✅       ✅       ✅   → FULL SUPPORT

Result: 100% Coverage - Every browser/device supported


ERROR HANDLING FLOW
===================

Three.js Initialization Failure
    |
    +---> catch (error)
    |     └─> Show Fallback UI
    |         ├─ "3D Preview Not Available"
    |         ├─ "🌐 View Online" button
    |         ├─ "⬇️ Download Local" button
    |         └─ Viewing options guide
    |
    └─> User Chooses Action
         ├─> "View Online" → viewOnline3DViewer()
         │   └─> 3DViewer.net iframe loads
         │
         └─> "Download Local" → downloadModel()
             └─> .stl file downloads


STL Load Failure
    |
    +---> catch (error)
    |     └─> Show Same Fallback UI
    |         (Consistent experience)
    |
    └─> User Same Options
         ├─> "View Online" → 3DViewer.net
         └─> "Download Local" → Save file


USER EXPERIENCE PATHS (Decision Tree)
======================================

START: Generate 3D Model
|
+--- Path 1: Modern Browser + WebGL Available
|    └─> Three.js Loads → Interactive Viewer ✅
|        └─> User inspects model
|            └─> [Download button available]
|
+--- Path 2: Old Browser or WebGL Disabled
|    └─> Three.js Fails → Fallback UI
|        ├─> User clicks "View Online"
|        │   └─> 3DViewer.net loads ✅
|        │       └─> User inspects model
|        │           └─> [Download button in header]
|        │
|        └─> User clicks "Download Local"
|            └─> File downloads ✅
|                └─> User opens in desktop software
|
+--- Path 3: WebGL Available but STL Fails
|    └─> Similar to Path 2
|        └─> Fallback UI shows
|            └─> User has same options
|
+--- Path 4: User Prefers Local Software
|    └─> Click "Download Local" (anytime)
|        └─> .stl downloads ✅
|            └─> Open with:
|                ├─ Windows 3D Viewer (built-in)
|                ├─ Blender (free, professional)
|                ├─ MeshLab (free, specialized)
|                └─ Fusion 360 (professional CAD)
|
END: Model Viewed Successfully
