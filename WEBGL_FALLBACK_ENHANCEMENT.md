# Browser WebGL Fallback Enhancement - Complete

## Issue Addressed

User's browser doesn't support WebGL or hardware acceleration is disabled, preventing in-browser 3D model viewing. However, the 3D model is generated successfully.

## Solution Implemented

Updated `synexa-style-studio.html` with enhanced fallback UI that:

1. **Acknowledges the problem** - Clear communication that WebGL is unavailable
2. **Confirms success** - Emphasizes that model was generated successfully
3. **Provides download** - Prominent download button
4. **Guides alternatives** - Lists 5+ professional viewing options
5. **Offers solutions** - Help users enable WebGL or find alternatives
